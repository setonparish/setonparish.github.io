              Our previous Seton Parish Festival was held September 15 - 17, 2017.
            </p>
            <p>
              We had beautiful weather the entire weekend and enjoyed spending time with our parishioners and the entire surrounding community.
            <p>
              We celebrated with Parrots of the Caribbean, cheered for Reelin' in The Years, and rocked out with The Reaganomics.  We ate a lot of amazing food, screamed on some rides, and won some raffles.
            </p>
            <p>
              The dates for the next festival have already been set!
            </p>
            <p>
              <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#C8341C;">Our 29th annual festival will be held September 7 - 9, 2018</span> and we cannot wait to celebrate again with you and your family.
