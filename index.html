            Our previous Seton Parish Festival was held August 12 - 14, 2022.
          </p>
          <p>
            On Friday, we celebrated with The Crooked Highway Band. We ate a lot of amazing food,
            screamed on some rides, talked with friends, and won some raffles.
            <p>
              On Saturday, the weather was beautiful and the crowds came in droves to enjoy the amazing homecooked food.
              Long Play took the stage and brought so much energy we thought the lights in Pickerington would dim.
            </p>
            <p>
              Thank you to the entire community that came out to enjoy the festival. It felt like one large family,
              eating, laughing, and enjoying our time together. We simply cannot wait to celebrate again with you and
              your family next year.
            </p>
